This is a testing or POC page for implenting an online store using Shopify, there are 3 folders

`ecommerce-next-bkp`: is the code alone that I followed, but in some point something broke, I left because there is the setup for the most recent (at this point) version 
for next, PostCSS and Tailwind, left it just as a reference but NOT WORKING

`next-ecommerce`: This is the frontend of the application you can initialize it with `npm run dev`

`next-shopify-local`: This is the "test" backend to work with, is not shopify but it has the models and such thing needed for typescript and so on

In a nutshell the only thing you need to run this project with a shopify implementation is `next-ecommerce`, you can work on dev environment using `next-shopify-local`
but gotta maintain the typescript definitions and such as Shopify defines them
